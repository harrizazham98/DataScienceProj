This is my personal project on data science where I get the dataset from open source such as Kaggle. From this personal project, I apply some fundamentals I learn such as feature engineering, feature selection and model training. Fro coding part, I code mostly in Python ( but some of them in Java) to access libraries which can help me to access to popular libraries such as sklearn, numpy, pandas, tensorflow and DL4J. In this repo, I document my work on some applications.
